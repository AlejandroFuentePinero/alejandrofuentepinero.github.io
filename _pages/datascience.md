## Welcome to my Data Science portfolio
This section showcases my projects, curated learning builds, and translated research case studies. Use Projects to see end-to-end work first, then Skills, Education, and Communication for supporting context.

      <strong>Job Intelligence Engine</strong> — an end-to-end pipeline that turns real job ads into a skill taxonomy,
      fit-for-purpose models, and decision-ready outputs for role targeting and upskilling. Built with reproducible
      architecture and documented evaluation.
