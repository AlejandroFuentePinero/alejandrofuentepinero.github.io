## Welcome to my Data Science portfolio
This section showcases my projects, curated learning builds, and translated research case studies. Use Projects to see end-to-end work first, then Skills, Education, and Communication for supporting context.

## Featured work
**Job Intelligence Engine** — an end-to-end pipeline that turns real job ads into a skill taxonomy, fit-for-purpose models, and decision-ready outputs for role targeting and upskilling. Built with reproducible architecture and documented evaluation.
