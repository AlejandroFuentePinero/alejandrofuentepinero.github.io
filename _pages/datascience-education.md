### Formal Education

- **Ph.D. in Zoology and Ecology**, James Cook University â€” *Cum laude* (2024)  
  Designed and implemented advanced analytical workflows to assess climate change impacts on tropical wildlife.  
  - Developed **novel modelling techniques** combining **Bayesian inference**, **machine learning**, **physiological**, **climatic**, and **spatial modelling** (GIS, remote sensing).  
  - Managed large, multi-source ecological and climate datasets, including **data cleaning**, **relational database design**, and **automated pipelines** for data integration.  
  - Applied **predictive modelling** to identify high-risk events and vulnerable habitats, integrating physiological and biogeochemical data (e.g., soil and foliage chemistry).  
  - Extensive experience in **R** (statistical programming) and reproducible research practices.  

- **M.S. in Biology and Conservation of Biodiversity**, Universidad de Salamanca (2016)  
  Advanced training in quantitative ecology and conservation planning.  
  - Coursework in **GIS**, **advanced statistics**, **statistical programming** (R), and **applied statistical modelling**.  
  - Applied coding and spatial analysis to biodiversity monitoring and conservation decision-making.  
  - Experience in designing and executing analytical workflows for ecological datasets.  

- **B.S. in Biology**, Universidad de Salamanca (2014)  
  Broad foundation in organismal biology, ecology, and environmental sciences, supported by strong quantitative training.  
  - Coursework in **mathematics**, **algebra**, **biostatistics**, and **physics**.  
  - Completed a research project on **ecological modelling**, integrating environmental and species distribution data.  
  - Gained initial experience with statistical programming and data analysis workflows.
