## Hi, I’m Alejandro — Researcher & Data Scientist

I work at the interface of **quantitative ecology** and **data science**, using advanced analytical approaches to understand biodiversity and environmental change.

My **academic research** explores how species respond to **climate change** — from the microclimates experienced by endangered rainforest possums to the large-scale redistribution of tropical montane birds.

In **data science**, I apply the same modelling and forecasting principles to broader problems, building solutions that are **rigorous, transparent, and actionable** across scientific and applied contexts.

## Bridging Research & Application

What drives me is **turning complexity into clarity**.  
I develop and apply tools such as **hierarchical Bayesian models**, **spatiotemporal analysis**, and **machine learning** to:

- Reveal patterns in high-dimensional ecological and environmental data.  
- Forecast change and uncertainty under future scenarios.  
- Support decision-making with evidence-based, interpretable results.  

Whether in **conservation science** or **applied analytics**, my goal is to produce insights that can be **acted upon** — helping managers, stakeholders, and communities **respond to change with confidence**.
