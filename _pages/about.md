## Hi, I’m Alejandro — Researcher & Data Scientist

I work at the interface of **ecology** and **data science**, using advanced analytical approaches to tackle complex questions about biodiversity and environmental change.

My **academic research** focuses on understanding how species respond to climate change — from the fine-scale microclimates experienced by endangered spectacled flying foxes to the large-scale redistribution of tropical montane birds.  
My **data science work** applies many of the same modelling, forecasting, and analytical skills to broader problems, developing solutions that are rigorous, transparent, and actionable.

## Bridging Research & Application

What drives me is turning complexity into clarity.  
I use tools such as hierarchical Bayesian models, spatiotemporal analysis, and machine learning to:
- Reveal patterns in high-dimensional ecological and environmental data.
- Forecast changes under future scenarios.
- Support decision-making with evidence-based strategies.

Whether working in conservation, policy, or applied analytics, my goal is to produce insights that can be **acted upon** — helping managers, stakeholders, and communities respond to change.
