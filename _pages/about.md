# PhD Research: Climate Change Impacts on Tropical Montane Biodiversity

My doctoral research investigated the complex impacts of climate change on tropical montane ecosystems, with a focus on how shifting climatic conditions affected biodiversity in the Australian Wet Tropics. Drawing on three decades of region-wide monitoring, I examined the abundance–suitability relationships, community reshuffling, and population responses of rainforest birds and endemic ringtail possums to both gradual warming and extreme heatwaves. By integrating experimental studies with ecological modelling, my work unravelled the physiological mechanisms—such as reduced survival, recruitment, and foraging performance—that underpinned climate-induced declines. Overall, my thesis provided critical insights into the causal links between environmental change and population dynamics, laying the groundwork for evidence-based conservation strategies in these natural laboratories.
