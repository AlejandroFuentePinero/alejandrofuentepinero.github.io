# Welcome!

## Hi, I’m Alejandro — Researcher & Data Scientist

I work where **quantitative ecology** meets **data science** — building models that help explain how living systems change, and what those changes mean in the real world.

In **academia**, I study how species respond to **climate change**, from the microclimates experienced by endangered rainforest possums to the large-scale redistribution of tropical montane bird communities.

In **data science**, I bring the same modelling mindset to applied problems: careful assumptions, clear uncertainty, and outputs that people can actually use. The common thread is simple — **rigour with practical impact**.

## Bridging Research & Application

What motivates me is **turning complexity into clarity**.

I use tools like **hierarchical Bayesian models**, **spatiotemporal analysis**, and **machine learning** to:

- uncover patterns in high-dimensional ecological and environmental data  
- forecast change (and quantify uncertainty) under future scenarios  
- support decisions with results that are transparent and interpretable  

Whether I’m working in **conservation science** or **applied analytics**, my goal is the same: deliver insights that can be **acted on** — helping teams respond to change with confidence.
