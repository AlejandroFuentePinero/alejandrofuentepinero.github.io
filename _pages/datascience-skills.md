## Summary
Data scientist with a **research-grade modelling foundation** (spatiotemporal + hierarchical Bayesian population modelling) and **end-to-end ML delivery** (Python pipelines, evaluation, interpretability, recommender outputs). Strong scientific communication and publication record.

---

## 1) Research Practice (PhD / Publications)
- Peer-reviewed writing; methods-first documentation; reproducible reporting  
- Oral presentations (conferences, stakeholder briefings); scientific storytelling  
- Teaching and mentoring (students/collaborators; code + modelling support)  
- Project management: scoping, prioritisation, milestones, delivery under constraints  

---

## 2) Data Science Workflow
- EDA, data cleaning, missingness strategies, outliers, leakage checks, sanity checks  
- Feature engineering: encoding, scaling, transformations, selection  
- Validation design: train/val/test, cross-validation, baseline discipline, overfitting control  
- Evaluation: classification/regression metrics, calibration awareness, error analysis
