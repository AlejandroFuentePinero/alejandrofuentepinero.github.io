## Problem
Forest gaps alter microhabitat structure and resource availability, potentially affecting the abundance of tropical species. Understanding these changes requires a robust statistical approach capable of testing abundance responses along a continuous gradient.

**Goal:** Develop an analytical framework using **generalised linear models (GLMs)** to quantify abundance changes for tropical species across forest gap gradients.

## Approach
- Collaborated with field ecologists to integrate survey data from multiple forest sites spanning gap size and position.
- Applied **GLMs** with appropriate error structures to model species abundance as a function of gap-related covariates (e.g., gap size, distance to edge).
- Assessed significance of trends, controlled for site-level variability, and validated models through residual diagnostics.

## Stack
- **Statistical modelling**: GLMs for abundance–gradient relationships.
- **Data workflows**: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model validation.
- **Implementation**: performed entirely in **R**, with reproducible scripts for all analytical steps.

## Results
- Quantified abundance responses for multiple species, revealing both positive and negative trends along gap gradients.
- Provided effect size estimates and confidence intervals to guide ecological interpretation.

## Impact
- Supplied a reproducible analytical framework for assessing habitat gradient effects on species abundance.
- Results contributed directly to the publication and interpretation of forest gap ecology in tropical systems.
