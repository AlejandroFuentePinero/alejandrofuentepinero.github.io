## Problem
Mastering machine learning requires understanding both **theory and practice** ‚Äî how algorithms behave with real data, how to prepare features, and how to evaluate model performance.  
**Goal:** Build a comprehensive, hands-on portfolio of ML mini-projects that demonstrate end-to-end workflows for key algorithms in Python, each grounded in applied examples.

## Approach
- Created a structured repository with subprojects covering:
  - **Regression:** Linear and Polynomial Regression  
  - **Classification:** Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - **Ensemble Methods:** Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
  - **Clustering:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Naive Bayes text classification and TF-IDF feature extraction  
  - **Deep Learning:** Neural Networks using TensorFlow and Keras  
- Implemented complete **data preprocessing ‚Üí model training ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí visualization** workflows using Scikit-learn and supporting libraries.  
- Emphasized algorithmic intuition through visual diagnostics (e.g., decision boundaries, feature importance, ROC curves). 

## Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow`, `keras`  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub  
- **Concepts:** supervised & unsupervised learning, model validation, scaling, feature engineering, interpretability, neural networks

## Structure
Each section of the repository represents a standalone ML module from the Udemy course:
1. Linear Regression  
2. Logistic Regression  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
4. Decision Trees and Random Forests  
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
6. K-Means Clustering  
7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
8. Recommender Systems  
9. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
10. Neural Nets and Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras
11. Cross-validation
12. Big Data and Spark with Python

## Results
- Developed a **complete portfolio of machine learning workflows** covering both predictive and unsupervised methods.  
- Strengthened understanding of data preparation, evaluation metrics, and model trade-offs.  
- Created a modular learning resource that can be extended with more advanced algorithms.

## Impact
- Establishes a solid foundation for **practical ML application and interpretability**.  
- Serves as a bridge between exploratory data analysis (EDA) and more advanced AI/ML workflows.  
- Complements the ‚ÄúPython OOP Mini-Systems‚Äù and ‚ÄúEDA Projects‚Äù repositories as part of a coherent progression from programming ‚Üí exploration ‚Üí modelling.
