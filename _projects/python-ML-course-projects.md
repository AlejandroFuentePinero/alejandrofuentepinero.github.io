## Problem
Mastering machine learning requires understanding both theory and practice — how algorithms behave with real data, how to prepare features, and how to evaluate model performance. This project builds a hands-on portfolio of mini-projects that demonstrate end-to-end ML workflows in Python.

## Approach
- Created a structured repository with subprojects covering:
  - **Regression:** Linear and Polynomial Regression  
  - **Classification:** Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
  - **Ensemble Methods:** Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
  - **Clustering:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Naive Bayes text classification and TF-IDF feature extraction  
  - **Deep Learning:** Neural Networks using TensorFlow and Keras  
- Implemented complete **data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → visualization** workflows using Scikit-learn and supporting libraries.  
- Emphasised algorithmic intuition through visual diagnostics (e.g., decision boundaries, feature importance, ROC curves). 

## Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow`, `keras`  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub  
- **Concepts:** EDA, data manipulation, supervised & unsupervised learning, model validation, scaling, feature engineering, interpretability, neural networks

## Structure
Each section of the repository represents a standalone ML project:
1. Linear Regression  
2. Logistic Regression  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
4. Decision Trees and Random Forests  
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
6. K-Means Clustering  
7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
8. Recommender Systems  
9. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
10. Neural Nets and Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras
11. Cross-validation
12. Introduction to Big Data and PySpark workflows

## Results and Impact
* Developed a complete, modular portfolio of ML workflows covering predictive and unsupervised methods.
* Strengthened understanding of data preparation, evaluation metrics, and model trade-offs.
* Strengthened proficiency in data storytelling and visualisation using modern Python tools.
This repository establishes a practical foundation for model interpretability and applied machine learning, bridging exploratory data analysis and advanced AI workflows. It complements the Python OOP Mini-Systems, EDA Projects, and Coding Challenges repositories as part of a coherent learning progression.
