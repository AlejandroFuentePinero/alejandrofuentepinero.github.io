## Problem
Tropical montane bird populations are increasingly threatened by climate change and extreme events, but detecting climate-driven signals in noisy, long-term monitoring data is challenging.  
**Goal:** Use **Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal models** to quantify how climate variables and cyclone impacts drive population change, integrating multi-scale environmental predictors from remote sensing.

## Approach
- Assembled multi-decadal bird abundance datasets across rainforest sites in the Australian Wet Tropics.
- Derived spatiotemporal climate predictors, including temperature, precipitation, and cyclone exposure indices, at the site-year level.
- Processed high-resolution **satellite imagery** to quantify cyclone-induced changes in rainforest vegetation structure.
- Integrated climate and vegetation metrics into a **hierarchical Bayesian framework** to model abundance in a multidimensional space:  
  - State process: latent population dynamics across space and time.  
  - Observation process: detection probability from repeated surveys.
- Ran models in **JAGS** with spatial and temporal random effects, quantifying effect sizes, uncertainty, and spatial heterogeneity in climate impacts.

## Stack
- **Bayesian spatiotemporal modelling**: spatial random effects, temporal trends, and covariate integration.
- **Remote sensing integration**: processed satellite imagery to derive vegetation change metrics.
- **Advanced statistical modelling**: detectionâ€“abundance separation, credible interval estimation.
- **Data workflows**: large-scale data cleaning, spatial joins, reproducible analysis pipelines.
- **Implementation**: conducted in **R** for data processing/visualisation and **JAGS** for model specification and inference, under version control.

## Results
- Identified significant negative population responses to cyclone-driven vegetation loss and to climate warming in several species.
- Revealed spatial heterogeneity in climate impact strength, with higher elevations often showing stronger declines.
- Quantified uncertainty, enabling robust interpretation for conservation planning.

## Impact
- Provided direct evidence linking extreme climatic events and long-term warming to bird population declines in the Wet Tropics.
- Informed adaptive management strategies and reinforced the case for targeted conservation action in climate-vulnerable habitats.
