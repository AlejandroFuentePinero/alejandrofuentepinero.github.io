## Problem
Transitioning from analytical scripting to **structured software development** requires mastery of programming fundamentals â€” including control flow, modular design, encapsulation, and class hierarchies.  
**Goal:** Build a progression of small but complete Python systems that demonstrate increasing complexity â€” from procedural games to multi-class object-oriented applications â€” consolidating software engineering skills for data and analytics workflows.

## Approach
- Designed a **series of milestone projects** advancing from basic function decomposition (Tic-Tac-Toe) to full class orchestration (Library System).  
- Implemented **OOP principles** such as composition, inheritance, and polymorphism across multiple domains (banking, scheduling, inventory, lending).  
- Applied defensive programming, algorithmic reasoning (e.g., Luhn algorithm for credit card validation), and structured error handling.  
- Developed reusable CLI systems emphasizing clean interaction loops, input validation, and modular code structure.  
- Organized all projects into a unified, documented repository for maintainability and demonstration of cumulative learning.

## Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Core libraries:** `datetime`, `re`, `sys`, `os`  
- **Programming concepts:** procedural programming, OOP (classes, composition, inheritance, polymorphism), algorithms, CRUD logic, state management  
- **Development tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git/GitHub for version control

## Examples
- **Tic-Tac-Toe (CLI):** procedural function decomposition for board rendering, validation, and replay loop.  
- **Blackjack (CLI):** class composition (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Chips`) for game logic and state control.  
- **Credit Card Validator:** implemented the **Luhn algorithm** and rule-based card classification (Visa/MasterCard).  
- **Bank Account Manager:** inheritance and polymorphism with `Account` subclasses and `Bank` orchestration for transfers.  
- **Product Inventory:** CRUD system linking `Inventory` and `Product` classes for add/remove/update/search workflows.  
- **Library Lending System:** inheritance and polymorphism with `Item` subclasses (`Book`, `Journal`, `DVD`), plus `Member` and `Loan` tracking.

## Results
- Demonstrated **strong OOP understanding** through layered class systems and interactive logic.  
- Built a portfolio of clean, modular codebases representing **progressive software design complexity**.  
- Established a foundation for scaling Python skills into data engineering, analytics, and applied ML workflows.

## Impact
- Consolidated **core programming fluency** â€” a prerequisite for professional data science and AI development.  
- Provided a public reference repository that documents **learning-to-implementation progression**, showcasing both conceptual and practical mastery.  
- Serves as a teaching and reference tool for future learners or collaborators seeking to understand Python OOP fundamentals in action.

## Links & Resources
- ðŸ’» **Code repository:** [GitHub â€“ Python OOP Mini-Systems](https://github.com/AlejandroFuentePinero/python-oop-mini-systems)

## Role
- Designed and implemented all systems from scratch.  
- Documented the full codebase and learning progression.  
- Structured the repository for clarity, modularity, and reusability.
