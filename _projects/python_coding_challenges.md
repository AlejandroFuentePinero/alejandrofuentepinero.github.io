## Overview
**Goal:** Develop practical Python fluency through a series of small, self-contained challenges that blend logical reasoning, data manipulation, and lightweight system design.  
Each challenge mirrors a realistic problem â€” from building small data systems to writing automation scripts or analysing mini-datasets â€” encouraging flexible, creative solutions rather than following fixed templates.

---

## Approach
- Designed a **progressive learning framework** with 10â€“60 min projects.  
- Challenges cover diverse topics: loops, conditionals, functions, dictionaries, classes, and basic data analysis.  
- Each project emphasises:
  - Choosing the right data structure for the task.  
  - Writing clear, modular, and reusable code.  
  - Reflecting on design trade-offs and reasoning behind implementation choices.  
- Scaffolding levels (easy, moderate, hard, and very hard) gradually reduce guidance to foster autonomy and real-world coding intuition.

## Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

---

## Impact
- Builds the foundation for confident, creative Python thinking applicable across data science and software development.  
- Demonstrates consistent, structured self-learning and applied problem-solving ability.  
- Serves as a living portfolio of progressively complex, well-documented code mini-systems.
