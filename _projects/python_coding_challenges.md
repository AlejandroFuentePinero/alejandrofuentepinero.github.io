## Overview
**Goal:** Build strong, intuitive Python fluency through a series of small, self-contained challenges that combine logical reasoning, data manipulation, and lightweight system design.  
Each challenge mirrors a realistic problem, encouraging flexible and creative approaches rather than step-by-step replication.

---

## Approach
- Designed a **progressive learning framework** with 30–60 min projects.  
- Each project emphasises:
  - Choosing the right data structure for the task.  
  - Writing clear, modular, and reusable code.  
  - Reflecting on design trade-offs and reasoning behind implementation choices.  
- Scaffolding levels (easy, moderate, hard, and very hard) gradually reduce guidance to foster autonomy and real-world coding intuition.

---

## Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

---

## Impact
- Strengthens reasoning and design fluency across diverse Python paradigms.  
- Builds habits of clean coding, modular thinking, and defensive programming.  
- Demonstrates structured self-learning and applied problem-solving capabilities relevant to data science and software development
