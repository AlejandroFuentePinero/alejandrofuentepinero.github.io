## Problem
In competitive **Magic: The Gathering**, optimising the balance of resources (e.g., lands vs. spells) in a deck is crucial for consistent gameplay outcomes.  
Players often rely on intuition or static charts, but an interactive, parameterised probability tool can make the process data-driven.

**Goal:** Create a fully interactive, browser-based tool to model draw probabilities for different deck configurations and help players optimise resource distribution.

## Approach
- Designed a **hypergeometric probability model** to estimate the likelihood of drawing specific resources within defined game stages, given deck composition.
- Implemented the probability engine in **JavaScript** for client-side computation, enabling instant recalculation as users adjust deck size, land count, and draw parameters.
- Built a responsive UI using **HTML/CSS** for clarity and mobile compatibility.
- Hosted via **GitHub Pages** for free public access without server infrastructure.

## Stack
- **Mathematical foundation**: hypergeometric distribution for discrete draw probabilities.
- **Frontend development**: JavaScript for logic and interactivity, HTML/CSS for structure and styling.
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages hosting for frictionless user access.

## Results
- Delivered a tool where players can adjust inputs and instantly view probability curves and summary statistics.
- Enabled scenario testing for resource distribution, improving deck consistency and performance.
- Supported competitive decision-making with rigorous, data-driven insights.

## Impact
- Showcases application of probability theory in a gaming context.
- Demonstrates ability to design, code, and deploy a performant, accessible interactive tool from scratch.
