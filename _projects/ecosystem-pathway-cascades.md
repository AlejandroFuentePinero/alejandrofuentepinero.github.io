## Problem
Ecosystems operate through complex direct and indirect interactionsâ€”understanding how herbivory cascades through biogeochemical processes is critical but structurally and statistically challenging.  
**Goal:** Model and disentangle direct and indirect pathways of ecosystem functioning using **Bayesian hierarchical models**, clarifying cascading effects in biogeochemical dynamics.

## Approach
- Compiled experiments and observations quantifying herbivory rates, litter decomposition, nutrient fluxes, and other ecosystem variables in montane rainforests.
- Built **Bayesian hierarchical models** that capture:
  - Direct effects (e.g., plant defences â†’ herbivory)
  - Indirect pathways (e.g., mediated through soil nutrient flux or climatic processes)
  - Random effects across sites and time (hierarchical nesting).
- Quantified cascading impacts via posterior analysis of structured pathway coefficients.
  
## Stack
- **Hierarchical Bayesian modelling**: direct and indirect effect estimation within structured ecological networks.
- **Biogeochemical pathway analysis**: handling multiple response variables in a network framework.
- **Data workflows**: data integration from field measurements, cleaning, reproducible analysis pipeline.
- **Implementation**: executed in **R** for processing and visualisation, and **JAGS** for model specification, all under version control for transparency.

## Results
- Identified both direct herbivory and mediated biogeochemical effects contributing to ecosystem dynamics.
- Generated quantitative estimates of pathway strengths and uncertainty, revealing cascading structuring across trophic and nutrient cycles.

## Impact
- Advanced understanding of ecosystem functioning by quantifying complex ecological cascades.
- Provided a modelling framework transferable to similar tropical ecosystem studies and management scenarios.
