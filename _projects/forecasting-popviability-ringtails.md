## Problem
Understanding population sustainability is critical to conservation prioritisationâ€”but count data are often imperfect and biased by detection issues.  
**Goal:** Build robust forecasts of population viability using **Bayesian hierarchical models** that explicitly account for detection probability, to inform elevated conservation listing at national and international levels.

## Approach
- Collated long-term count data with imperfect detection from population monitoring of targeted species.  
- Built **Bayesian hierarchical models**: observation process (detection component) separated from true state process (abundance/trend).  
- Integrated prior knowledge and error structures to model latent population trends and forecast future viability under current and projected conditions.  
- Derived **population viability metrics** (e.g., extinction probability, trend trajectories), feeding decisions for national/international conservation listings.

## Stack
- **Bayesian hierarchical modelling**: detectionâ€“abundance partitioning, forecasting of latent trends with credible intervals.  
- **Forecasting workflows**: dynamic prediction of future population trajectories under forecasted climate change, uncertainty quantification.  
- **Data workflows**: count data cleaning, variable development (climate change predictors), model fitting, posterior analysis, reproducible scripting and reporting.  
- **Implementation**: carried out in **R** (data processing, analysis, visualisation) and **JAGS** (Bayesian model specification and MCMC sampling), with full version control for transparency.


## Results
- Forecasted strong declines in target species with credible uncertainty bounds.  
- Identified species with high extinction risk over relevant time horizons.  
- Results directly contributed to elevating conservation priority status for those species under national and international protection lists.

## Impact
- Strengthened the scientific basis for conservation policy decisions by delivering rigorous, uncertainty-aware forecasts.  
- Demonstrated the value of integrating detection-corrected Bayesian models into species viability assessments.
