## Problem
Climate change is forcing species to redistribute uphill in montane ecosystems, but species migrate at different rates, reshaping community compositions and potentially accelerating upland extinctions.  
**Goal:** Forecast elevational community turnover across thousands of assemblages, using a streamlined, optimised spatial workflow capable of dynamic, simultaneous predictions for many species.

## Approach
- Compiled and harmonised spatial layers: species distribution models, thermal resistance surfaces, and elevational patch definitions.
- Simulated uphill shifts of 7,613 community assemblages using per-species dispersal probabilities and landscape resistance, then computed dissimilarity indices to quantify community restructuring.
- Engineered high-throughput and optimised code (parallel processing, efficient file I/O, streamlined loops) to run multi-spatial, multi-species forecasts significantly faster.  
- Enabled dynamic visualisation and batch processing to support interactive exploration and extensive scenario testing.

## Stack
- **Spatial forecasting**: improved workflows for handling high-resolution, multi-species predictions across elevational bands.  
- **Advanced statistical analyses**: dispersal success estimation, beta-diversity (dissimilarity) metrics, and patch-level population turnover.  
- **Workflow optimisation**: high-performance parallelisation, memory-efficient geospatial processing, reproducible scripting.  
- **Implementation**: all in **R**, with version control and data reproducibility.

## Results
- Mapped intense community turnover (reshuffling) along elevation gradients; particularly severe species co-occurrence declines at higher altitudes.
- Identification of "escalator to extinction" zones where communities are most vulnerable to future climate shifts.

## Impact
- Enabled a more nuanced, high-resolution understanding of community reshuffling under climate change.  
- Provided conservation forecasters and policymakers actionable outputs to prioritise monitoring and intervention in vulnerable elevational zones.
