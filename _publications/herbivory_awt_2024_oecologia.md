# Abstract

Herbivore–plant interactions are fundamental processes shaping ecosystems, yet their study is challenged by their complex connections within broader ecosystem processes, requiring a nuanced understanding of ecosystem dynamics. This study investigated the relationship between nutrient availability and insect herbivory in the Australian Wet Tropics. Our objectives were threefold. Firstly, to understand what factors influence nutrient availability for plants and herbivores across the landscape; secondly, to investigate how trees of different species respond to nutrient availability; and thirdly, to unravel how the relationships between resources and plant chemistry affect herbivory. We established a network of 25 study sites covering important abiotic gradients, including temperature, precipitation, and geology. Employing a hierarchical modelling approach, we assessed the influence of climate and geology on resource availability for plants, primarily in the form of soil nutrients. Then, we explored the influence of the above factors on the interaction between herbivory and foliage chemistry across three widespread rainforest tree species, comparing how these relationships emerged across genera. Our findings suggest an overarching influence of climate and geology over soil chemistry, foliar nitrogen, and insect herbivory, both directly and indirectly. However, individual constituents of soil fertility showed equivocal influences on spatial patterns of foliage chemistry once site geological origin was accounted for, suggesting a questionable relationship between individual soil nutrients and foliar composition. We have demonstrated that herbivore–plant interactions are complex dynamics regulated by an intricate web of relationships spanning different biogeochemical processes. While our results provide some support to the notion that herbivory is affected by resource availability, different species growing under the same conditions can show differing responses to the same resources, highlighting the importance of identifying specific limiting factors rather than simpler proxies of resource availability.
