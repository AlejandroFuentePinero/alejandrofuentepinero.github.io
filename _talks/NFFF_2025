Abstract - Flying foxes are highly vulnerable to extreme heat events, yet most assessments of heat exposure rely on ambient weather data that may not reflect the conditions experienced within roosts. We investigated how canopy microclimate varies with height and vegetation structure in spectacled flying fox roosts in the Australian Wet Tropics. Using temperature sensors placed across vertical strata, we found substantial differences—often exceeding several degrees—between the upper canopy and shaded understory, particularly during hot, clear days. These gradients suggest that roost selection and positioning within the canopy can significantly influence thermal exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating fine-scale microclimate data into vulnerability assessments, as reliance on standard meteorological measurements may underestimate the risks posed by extreme heat events.
